## Configuring MERN Stack on Your Local Machine Using GitHub and Daytona


### Introduction
Managing infrastructure to ensure smooth project delivery often involves overcoming numerous obstacles, particularly during the development environment setup. Frequent setup issues can hinder developers' ability to maintain consistent, repeatable, and easily deployable workspaces across various platforms. This guide examines how Daytona simplifies Development Environment Management (DEM), offering developers reliable workspaces that avoid common complications. It contrasts how to replicate a simple MERN stack repository locally from GitHub with and without Daytona.


### Technologies used
In the project that we are using for this guide, `Express` provides a web framework for creating robust APIs, and `MongoDB` serves as a NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval. `React` is used to build user interfaces. `Vite` provides a fast development server and optimized builds. `TailwindCSS`, a utility-first CSS framework, is used for quickly designing responsive and modern layouts. Other technologies used are:

- **CORS** middleware enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the backend API.
- **Dotenv** module loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- **Nodemon** automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected.
- **Recoil** manages the state of React applications.
- **Axios** is a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.


### Setting up the project locally:
In this section we'll walk you through setting up the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project locally using Git version control and Node.js runtime environment.

#### Step 1: Clone the Git Repository Locally
- Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository locally using the following command. Alternatively, you can download the zip file and extract its contents.
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
#### Step 2: Install Node.js on your machine:
- Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. To see if Node.js is installed on your machine, open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command. This will display the installed version of Node.js.
```bash
node --version
```
- If Node.js is not installed on your machine, download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.


- Adding Node.js to the system path


  **Windows:** Open the Settings and search for `Environment Variables`. Click on the `Environment Variables` button and select the `Path` variable. Click on the "Edit" button and add an entry: `.\node_modules\.bin`.


  **Linux / MacOS:** execute the following command:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/nodejs/bin
```
#### Step 3: How to Start the Backend Server
- Open your terminal or command prompt. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `backend` directory within the cloned repository and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following line in it. Change "Your Database Connection String" with real MongoDB connection uri.
```
MONGO_URI="Your Database Connection String"
```
- Start the backend server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```


#### Step 4: How to Start the Frontend
- Open your terminal or command prompt. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `frontend` directory within the cloned repository and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following line:
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/customers/"
```
- Start the frontend development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```
  Your React app should now be up and running.


### Problems with Conventional Setup
In the previous section, we set up our app locally. Setting up our app locally seems straightforward in theory, but in practice, it can be highly inefficient for productivity. Challenges arise from conflicting dependencies and library versions: some require older Node.js versions, while others demand newer ones. Manually resolving these conflicts is time-consuming and risky, with potential impacts on other projects if global changes are made. Ensuring consistency across team members is also complex due to variations in operating systems and configurations. The major issues with conventional setup are:

- **Dependency Management**: Traditional setups often face issues where different projects require conflicting versions of dependencies or libraries. Resolving these conflicts manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.<br><br>
- **Time Consumption**: Setting up development environments manually can consume valuable time that developers could otherwise spend on actual coding and development tasks.<br><br>
- **Collaboration Difficulties**: Maintaining consistency across team members' development environments can be challenging. Differences in operating systems, configurations, or installed software versions can lead to compatibility issues.
-**Security Concerns**: Manual setups may overlook security best practices, such as isolated environments or secure configurations, increasing vulnerability risks.
