## Configuring MERN Stack on Your Local Machine Using GitHub and Daytona


### Introduction
Managing infrastructure to ensure smooth project delivery often involves overcoming numerous obstacles, particularly during the development environment setup. Frequent setup issues can hinder developers' ability to maintain consistent, repeatable, and easily deployable workspaces across various platforms. This guide examines how Daytona simplifies Development Environment Management (DEM), offering developers reliable workspaces that avoid common complications. It contrasts how to replicate a simple MERN stack repository locally from GitHub with and without Daytona.


### Technologies used
`Daytona` and `Docker` are employed to automate development environment management. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side.


#### Backend Libraries and Frameworks
For the backend, `Express` provides a web framework for creating robust APIs, and `MongoDB` serves as a NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval. `Mongoose` simplifies data modeling and validation for MongoDB, while `CORS` middleware enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the backend API. The `Dotenv` module is used to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env, and Nodemon automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected.


#### Frontend Libraries and Frameworks
On the frontend, `React` is used to build user interfaces, and `Recoil` manages the state of React applications. `Axios` is a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests, and `Vite` provides a fast development server and optimized builds. `TailwindCSS`, a utility-first CSS framework, is used for quickly designing responsive and modern layouts.


### Setting up the project without Daytona


In this section, we will set up this repository locally without Daytona.


#### Step 1: Clone the Git Repository Locally
- Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository locally using the following command. Alternatively, you can download the zip file and extract its contents.
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
#### Step 2: Install Node.js
- To check if Node.js is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
node --version
```
- If Node.js is not installed on your machine, download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.


- Adding Node.js to the system path


  **Windows:** Open the Settings and search for `Environment Variables`. Click on the `Environment Variables` button and select the `Path` variable. Click on the "Edit" button and add an entry: `.\node_modules\.bin`.


  **Linux / MacOS:** execute the following command:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/nodejs/bin
```
#### Step 3: How to Start the Backend Server
- Open your terminal or command prompt. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `backend` directory within the cloned repository and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following line in it. Change "Your Database Connection String" with real MongoDB connection uri.
```
MONGO_URI="Your Database Connection String"
```
- Start the backend server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```


#### Step 4: How to Start the Frontend
- Open your terminal or command prompt. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `frontend` directory within the cloned repository and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following line:
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/customers/"
```
- Start the frontend development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```
  Your React app should now be up and running.


### Problems with Conventional Setup


- **Dependency Management**: Traditional setups often face issues where different projects require conflicting versions of dependencies or libraries. Resolving these conflicts manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.<br><br>
- **Time Consumption**: Setting up development environments manually can consume valuable time that developers could otherwise spend on actual coding and development tasks.<br><br>
